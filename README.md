## TL;DR

- [List organized by extension, JSON format](pub/extensions.json)
- [List organized by category, JSON format](pub/categories.json)

## Introduction

This project maintains reusable collections of common file extensions
categorised per typology. It can be used by any program to quickly
distinguish between file types.

Such an approach works much faster than recognition by mime/type or using
[libmagic](
https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man3/libmagic.3.html), but is of
course less precise.

The raw data is under [data](data), while generated formats and tools
can be found on the [projects pages](
https://dyne.github.io/file-extension-list).

## Organisation

### Categories

Each category is a file named after a generic typology stored in `data/categories/`:

| file.csv | description |
| --- | ---------- |
| [archive](data/categories/archive.csv)  | archives and disc images |
| [audio](data/categories/audio.csv)  | playable audio |
| [book](data/categories/book.csv)  | electronic books |
| [code](data/categories/code.csv)  | code in machine languages |
| [exec](data/categories/exec.csv)  | executable binaries |
| [font](data/categories/font.csv)  | typography fonts |
| [image](data/categories/image.csv)  | static images |
| [sheet](data/categories/sheet.csv)  | spreadsheets |
| [slide](data/categories/slide.csv)  | presentations and slides |
| [text](data/categories/text.csv)  | text in human languages |
| [video](data/categories/video.csv)  | moving images |
| [web](data/categories/web.csv)  | web developers bread and butter |

Inside each category file there is a file extension string
in the first column.
This collection is not complete...
and knowing how standards go: it will never be.
[We welcome your contribution](
https://github.com/dyne/file-extension-list/pulls).

Some extensions (for instance `html`, see #10 and #11)
may belong to more than one category:
`code` or `web`.
In these cases, any extra occurrence of the extension
will be marked `%` in the second column,
to mark it as duplicate of another categorisation
that took priority.

To establish the category of a single file
one can simply ignore all duplicate extensions
(those containing `%` in the second column).
Duplicates may be useful to establish the category of a directory
containing multiple files [by means of fuzzy logic](
https://github.com/dyne/file-extension-list/pull/10#issuecomment-529363535).

### Extensions

The file [`data/extensions.csv`](data/extensions.csv)
contains meta-data per file-extension.
The columns explained:

| column number: | 1. | 2. | 3. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| title: | file-extension | open/closed/uncategorized | text/binary/uncategorized |
| possible values: | `*` | `o/c/-` | `t/b/-` |

## Quick start

The current data is available for download in JSON format:

- [List organized by extension, JSON format](pub/extensions.json)
- [List organized by category, JSON format](pub/categories.json)

To change extensions and categories one can edit them inside the
`data/` directory and then use `make` to render new JSON files:

```
Usage:
  make <target>

General
  help             Display this help.
  list             list all categories and extensions
  dups             list all duplicate extensions present in more categories
  json-categories  build the json dictionary for { category: [ extensions.. ], .. }
  json-extensions  build the json dictionary for { extension: [ category ], .. }
  release          update the local render in pub/ for release
```

Launching `make list` will print on your terminal all currently known
extensions by category, for example:

```

## Code

You are meant to write your own code to parse file-extension-list.

This repository contains some example code in [./render](render).

To contribute, please file a pull request on
<https://github.com/dyne/file-extension-list/pulls>

## Usage

File-extension-list is used by the software application
[harvest](https://github.com/dyne/harvest)
for fast categorization of large amounts of directories
containing multiple file types.

You are welcome to let us know if you are using it too.
